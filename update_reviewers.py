"""
Parse the updated review and contributor data.
Make sure each contributor has the packages they've served
as reviewer or editor for.
Add a new person if they don't exist in the contributor
file.

Right now this script is pulling from a contributor pickle file
creating in the parse-contributors.py file. However it might be better
to integrate the three scripts at some point.

To run:
python3 update_reviewers.py
