"""
This script parses through our packages.yml and contributors.yml files
and:

1. Updates reviewer, editor and maintainer data in the contributor.yml file to
ensure all packages they supported are listed there.
1b: And that they have a listing as peer-review under contributor type
3. Finally it looks to see if we are missing review participants from
the review issues in the contributor file and updates that file.

This script assumes that update_contributors and update_reviews has been run.
Rather than hit any api's it just updates information from the issues.
To run: update_reviewers

# TODO - FEATURE we have some packages that were NOT approved but we had
# editors and reviewers who participated. We need to acknowledge these people
# Make sure each issue is tagged "on hold" and then parse contributions
# TODO: make sure the script recognizes a 3rd or 4th reviewer - crowsetta has
# this as will biocypher

    This function updates contributor's contribution types entries and the
     package reviews that they's contributed to in the `contribs` object which
    gets dumped into our contributors.yml file in the website repo.

    It also updates the contributors human name (if only the GitHub username is
    available in packages.yml) in
     the packages object IF that name is available in the contributors.yml file.

     Finally, if the contributor is new and not yet in our contributors.yml file,
     it adds them to the contribs object

    Parameters
    ----------
    user : ReviewUser
        The user object representing a person involved in the peer review process.
        Must have a GitHub username to process their data. Name is optional and
        is looked up from the contribs dict
    role : str
        The role of the user in the review process (e.g., "reviewer", "editor").
        Used to update their contributions in the contribs dict
    pkg_name : str
        The name of the package the user is contributing to or reviewing.
        Used to update their list of packages that they've supported through
        the review process
    contribs : dict[str, PersonModel]
        A dictionary mapping GitHub usernames to `PersonModel` objects. This
        contains information about all contributors and is updated in
        this function.
    processor : ProcessContributors
        A utility object for handling contributor processing logic, including
        role mapping and fetching contributor details.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[ReviewUser, dict[str, PersonModel]]
        - Updated `user` object, potentially with additional details (e.g., name).
        - Updated `contribs` dictionary, including any new contributor or or
        updated data for existing contributors.
