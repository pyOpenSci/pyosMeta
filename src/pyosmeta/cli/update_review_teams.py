"""
This script parses through our reviews and contributors and:

1. Updates reviewer, editor and maintainer data in the contributor.yml file to
ensure all packages they supported are listed there.
1b: And that they have a listing as peer-review under contributor type
2. Updates the packages metadata with the participants names if it's missing
3. Finally it looks to see if we are missing review participants from
the review issues in the contributor file and updates that file.

This script assumes that update_contributors and update_reviews has been run.
Rather than hit any api's it just updates information from the issues.
To run: update_reviewers

# TODO - FEATURE we have some packages that were NOT approved but we had
# editors and reviewers who participated. We need to acknowledge these people
# Make sure each issue is tagged "on hold" and then parse contributions
# TODO: package-wide feature: create no update flag for entries
# TODO: make sure the script recognizes a 3rd or 4th reviewer - crowsetta has
# this as will biocypher
