"""
A CLI script that parses through our existing contributor list stored
in pyopensci.github.io repo in the _data/contributors.yml file.

This script should respect if a persons's name is in the contributor file,
then it should be able to retain that name as their desired name (they can update
that file if they wish). It should NOT overwrite that name

It can also use that name when searching for maintainers
