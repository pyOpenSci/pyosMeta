"""
This script parses through our reviews and contributors and:

1. Updates reviewer, editor and maintainer data in the contributor.yml file to
ensure all packages they supported are listed there.
1b: And that they have a listing as peer-review under contributor type
2. Updates the packages metadata with the participants names if it's missing
3. FUTURE: finally it looks to see if we are missing review participants from
the review issues in the contributor file and updates that file.

This script assumes that update_contributors and update_reviews has been run.
Rather than hit any api's it just updates information from the issues.
To run: update_reviewers

# TODO - FEATURE we have some packages that were NOT approved but we had editors and reviewers.
# We need to acknowledge these people as well. maybe tag them with waiting on maintainer response??
# TODO: package-wide feature: create a flag for entries that we do not want to update
# TODO: make sure we can add a 3rd or 4th reviewer - crowsetta has this as
# will biocypher
# TODO: make sure to add a current editor boolean to the current editors and
# emeritus ones.
# TODO - ?create a class for person types??
