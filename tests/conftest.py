In your explanation, please address the following points (briefly, 1-2 sentences for each):  \r\n\r\n  - Who is the target audience and what are scientific applications of this package?\r\n  \r\nThe target audience is anyone who manages the generation, manipulation, or validation of netCDF files. This package can be applied to to these netCDF file tasks in any scientific discipline;\xa0although it would be most relevant to applications with large multidimensional datasets, e.g., for comparing climate models, for Earth science data reanalyses, and for remote sensing data.\r\n\r\n  - Are there other Python packages that accomplish the same thing? If so, how does yours differ?\r\n\r\nThe `ncdiff` function in the `nco` (netCDF Operators) library, as well as `ncmpidiff` and `nccmp`, compute value \r\ndifferences, but --- as far as we are aware --- do not have a dedicated function to show structural differences between netCDF4 datasets.  Our package, `ncompare` provides a light-weight Python-based tool for rapid **visual** comparisons of group & variable _structures_, _attributes_, and _chunking_.  \r\n\r\n  - If you made a pre-submission enquiry, please paste the link to the corresponding issue, forum post, or other discussion, or `@tag` the editor you contacted:\r\n\r\nPre-submission inquiry #142 \r\n\r\n## Technical checks\r\n\r\nFor details about the pyOpenSci packaging requirements, see our [packaging guide][PackagingGuide]. Confirm each of the following by checking the box. This package:\r\n\r\n- [x] does not violate the Terms of Service of any service it interacts with. \r\n- [x] uses an [OSI approved license][OsiApprovedLicense].\r\n- [x] contains a README with instructions for installing the development version. \r\n- [x] includes documentation with examples for all functions.\r\n- [x] contains a tutorial with examples of its essential functions and uses.\r\n- [x] has a test suite.\r\n- [x] has continuous integration setup, such as GitHub Actions CircleCI, and/or others.\r\n\r\n## Publication Options\r\n\r\n- [x] Do you wish to automatically submit to the [Journal of Open Source Software][JournalOfOpenSourceSoftware]? If so:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n <summary>JOSS Checks</summary>  \r\n\r\n- [x] The package has an **obvious research application** according to JOSS\'s definition in their [submission requirements][JossSubmissionRequirements]. Be aware that completing the pyOpenSci review process **does not** guarantee acceptance to JOSS. Be sure to read their submission requirements (linked above) if you are interested in submitting to JOSS.\r\n- [x] The package is not a "minor utility" as defined by JOSS\'s [submission requirements][JossSubmissionRequirements]: "Minor ‘utility’ packages, including ‘thin’ API clients, are not acceptable." pyOpenSci welcomes these packages under "Data Retrieval", but JOSS has slightly different criteria.\r\n- [(NOT YET)] The package contains a `paper.md` matching [JOSS\'s requirements][JossPaperRequirements] with a high-level description in the package root or in `inst/`.\r\n- [(NOT YET)] The package is deposited in a long-term repository with the DOI: \r\n\r\n*Note: JOSS accepts our review as theirs. You will NOT need to go through another full review. JOSS will only review your paper.md file. Be sure to link to this pyOpenSci issue when a JOSS issue is opened for your package.
