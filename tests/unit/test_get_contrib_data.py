It includes an interface for searching and downloading data from multiple data providers, data containers for image and time series data, commonly used solar coordinate frames and associated transformations, as well as other functionality needed for solar data analysis.\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\n\r\n- Please indicate which category or categories. \r\nCheck out our [package scope page][PackageCategories] to learn more about our \r\nscope. (If you are unsure of which category you fit, we suggest you make a pre-submission inquiry):\r\n\r\n\t- [X] Data retrieval\r\n\t- [X] Data extraction\r\n\t- [X] Data processing/munging\r\n\t- [ ] Data deposition\r\n\t- [ ] Data validation and testing\r\n\t- [X] Data visualization[^1]\t  \r\n\t- [ ] Workflow automation\r\n\t- [ ] Citation management and bibliometrics\r\n\t- [ ] Scientific software wrappers\r\n\t- [ ] Database interoperability\r\n\r\n## Domain Specific\r\n\r\n- [ ] Geospatial\r\n- [ ] Education\r\n\t\r\n## Community Partnerships\r\nIf your package is associated with a pyOpenSci partner community, please check below:\r\n\r\n- [ ] astropy\r\n- [x] sunpy\r\n- [ ] [Pangeo][pangeoWebsite]\r\n\t- [ ] My package adheres to the [Pangeo standards listed in the pyOpenSci peer review guidebook][PangeoCollaboration]\r\n\r\n## Technical checks\r\n\r\nFor details about the pyOpenSci packaging requirements, see our [packaging guide][PackagingGuide]. Confirm each of the following by checking the box. This package:\r\n\r\n- [X] does not violate the Terms of Service of any service it interacts with. \r\n- [X] uses an [OSI approved license][OsiApprovedLicense].\r\n- [X] contains a README with instructions for installing the development version. \r\n- [ ] includes documentation with examples for all functions.\r\n  **I will need to double check the examples, we have documentation for all public API**\r\n- [X] contains a tutorial with examples of its essential functions and uses.\r\n- [X] has a test suite.\r\n- [X] has continuous integration setup, such as GitHub Actions CircleCI, and/or others.\r\n\r\n## Are you OK with Reviewers Submitting Issues and/or pull requests to your Repo Directly?\r\nThis option will allow reviewers to open smaller issues that can then be linked to PR's rather than submitting a more dense text based review. It will also allow you to demonstrate addressing the issue via PR links.\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes I am OK with reviewers submitting requested changes as issues to my repo. Reviewers will then link to the issues in their submitted review.\r\n\r\nConfirm each of the following by checking the box.\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [author guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/author-guide.html). \r\n- [X] I expect to maintain this package for at least 2 years and can help find a replacement for the maintainer (team) if needed.\r\n\r\n## Please fill out our survey\r\n\r\n- [X] [Last but not least please fill out our pre-review survey](https://forms.gle/F9mou7S3jhe8DMJ16).
